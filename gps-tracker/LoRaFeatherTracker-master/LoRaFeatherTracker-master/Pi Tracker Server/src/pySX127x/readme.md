adapted from https://github.com/mayeranalytics/pySX127x

this code receives LoRa messages from tracker devices and uploads them to the Traccar server over http REST.

you may have to edit the LoRa.py from the original source repository to get your specific board to work if you are using something other than 
the Semtech module
